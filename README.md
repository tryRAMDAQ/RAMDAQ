> **A trading floor where the traders are AI, the stocks are real, and the bets are yours.**

Hedge Bots is a live, on-chain trading arena. Five AI **desks** — each with its own strategy — trade a basket of **real tokenized stocks** (NVIDIA, Tesla, SpaceX, the S&P 500) at **live on-chain prices**, building a **verifiable P&L** in real time. You **stake ETH** on whichever desk reads the market best; the top P&L takes the pot. No coin flips, no candles that mean nothing — just AI traders, real markets, and a bet on skill.

Every fill, every price, every payout is a real Robinhood Chain transaction you can click, recompute, and audit. **Nothing here is a simulation.**

**Three things make it work:**

| | |
|---|---|
| 🤖 **AI you can bet on** | Five distinct trading personalities — Blue Chip, Scalper, Whale, Degen, Momentum — reading the same live tape and betting against each other. Back the one you believe in, or build your own. |
| 📈 **Real markets, not a casino** | Every ticker is a real tokenized stock (RWA) on Robinhood Chain, priced off the live on-chain market. The P&L is *earned* — by reading the tape, not rolling dice. |
| 🔗 **Provable, not trusted** | Trades settle on-chain in **USDG**, every desk holds a real auditable wallet, and every fill is anchored on Robinhood Chain. Recompute any result yourself — zero trust in us. |

## 🎯 What Hedge Bots actually is

Picture a trading-desk tournament where the traders are **AI agents**, the market is a basket of **real tokenized stocks**, and the prize money is **real ETH** — except you can inspect every desk's strategy, watch every fill land on-chain live, and mathematically prove the standings were called honestly.

Here's the whole thing in five beats:

1. **A race opens.** Races run continuously — a **2-minute lobby** to enter, then a **5-minute race**, back-to-back, forever, no downtime.
2. **You build a desk.** Give it a name and pick its **strategy** — how aggressively it trades, how big its clips, which stocks it hunts. Stake ETH to enter — your stake joins the prize pot.
3. **Desks trade the market.** All race long, each desk sizes up the live tape and **buys and sells real stock tokens** at on-chain prices. Read the move right → the book grows. Buy the top → it bleeds.
4. **The board is a P&L.** A desk's score is its **profit and loss** — mark-to-market on live prices, updated every tick. The best *trader* wins, not the busiest one.
5. **Winner takes the pot.** At the bell, the desk with the highest P&L takes the **entire prize pot** (minus a small rake), paid straight to your wallet on-chain. Backers who side-bet on the winning desk split a second pool. Every fill and every payout is a real Robinhood Chain transaction you can click and inspect.

Nothing here is a mock-up. The ETH is real, the stock tokens are real, the prices are real, and **the outcome is provable** — that last part is the whole point.

## 🔁 The core loop: one race, start to finish

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Lobby
    Lobby --> Race: 120s · entries lock
    Race --> Settle: 5 min · the bell rings
    Settle --> Lobby: winner paid + P&L anchored on-chain
    note right of Race
      each desk trades every ~6s
      real stock tokens at live prices
      every fill anchored on-chain
      top P&L takes the pot
    end note
```

| Phase | Length | What's happening |
|---|---|---|
| 🟡 **Lobby** | 120 s | Entries are open. Build a desk, pick its strategy, **stake ETH** to join. The pot grows with every entrant. |
| 🏁 **Race** | 5 min | Entries lock. Desks trade the live basket — buying and selling real stock tokens, marked to market every tick. Side-bets stay open until 45 s before the bell. |
| 🔔 **Settlement** | seconds | Final P&L is **anchored on-chain**. The top-earning staked desk takes the pot (−5% rake). Backers of the overall #1 split the side pool. The next lobby opens instantly. |

**The rules are stacked to protect players, not the house:**
- Only one person staked? → **full refund.** No lonely-loser trap.
- Your payment lands after entries lock? → **auto-refunded** (30-second grace window).
- Nobody backed the winning desk in the side pool? → **every side-bet refunded.**
- **House desks can *never* take the prize pot** — they exist to keep the field full and give you something to bet on. Only real staked players can win it.

## 🧬 Agents are traders: strategy × conviction

A desk isn't a mascot — it's a tiny **trading strategy** defined by how often it trades, how big it bets, and which way it leans when the tape moves. Each starts every race with a **$10,000 book** and is scored purely on P&L.

| Desk | Style | Trades ~ | Clip size | The book |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 🔵 **Blue Chip** | trend-follow | 35% of ticks | 10% | Diversified megacaps, steady hands — AAPL / MSFT / GOOGL / AMZN / SPY. |
| 🟢 **Scalper** | mean-revert | 75% | 5% | Fast small clips, buys the dip across the whole basket. High-frequency grind. |
| 🟣 **Whale** | trend-follow | 12% | 35% | Rare, huge-conviction positions — SPY / MSFT / AAPL / NVDA. Bets big, bets seldom. |
| 🌸 **Degen** | momentum-chase | 60% | 18% | SpaceX, Coinbase, Tesla, NVIDIA — volatility or nothing. |
| 🟠 **Momentum** | momentum-chase | 25% | 22% | Waits, then strikes the single biggest mover in the basket. |

> *Style is how a desk reads the tape. **Trend-follow** buys strength and sells weakness; **mean-revert** buys the dip and fades the rip; **momentum-chase** hunts the biggest mover. Aggression (how often, how big) is the other half — a 75%-active scalper on 5% clips and a 12%-active whale on 35% clips are **completely different businesses**, and the leaderboard is a live argument about which one is winning today.*

## 📈 The stocks: a live on-chain market

This is the part that makes it *real*. The basket is **12 real Robinhood Stock Tokens** — ERC-20 tokens on Robinhood Chain, each a tokenized share (RWA) with a public contract address — priced off the **live on-chain market**, re-quoted **every 12 seconds** as the real market moves. Desks trade *these exact tokens*.

Prices come straight off the chain — not a feed we invent. The market moves under every desk in real time, and reading it right is the entire game.

## 🧾 The trades: real on-chain, real receipts

Every desk holds a **real Robinhood Chain wallet**, and the tape is anchored where anyone can audit it.

- **Real tokens, real balances.** Each desk's wallet holds real ETH, real **USDG** (Global Dollar — the on-chain stablecoin trades settle in), and real stock tokens. Its Blockscout page *is* its public résumé.
- **Fund with ETH, trade in USDG.** You fill a desk with ETH; it's converted to USDG and used to buy real stock tokens — the buy settles through an **on-chain executor contract**, leaving a real transaction with a real receipt.
- **The tape is anchored.** Fills batch-anchor into Robinhood Chain transactions, and the final P&L standings are anchored the same way — the record can't be quietly rewritten.
- **Click any of it.** Every fill, every settlement, every payout links straight through to Blockscout. No trusting us — the chain is the source of truth.
